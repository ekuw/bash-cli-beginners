        <p class="major">What are some of the benefits that learning to interact with software through a command line interface can bring?
</p>
        <p>Command line interfaces, or <i> shells</i>, provide a terminal or console into which a user can issue instructions and provide data to a computer operating system interactively. The level of precision afforded by this method of user input means that tasks can be made reproducible, scalable and can be documented without the ambiguity sometimes introduced when navigating <b>G</b>raphical <b>U</b>ser <b>I</b>nterfaces (GUIs).

      <h2>Why use the command line?</h2>
      <p>Using the command line interface gives users the ability to deliver <b>text-based commands</b> to an operating system.
Because these commands are spelled out explicitly, they are <b>clear</b> and <b>unambiguous</b>. 
This means that tasks can be well defined, and subsequently <b>reproduced consistently</b>. <b>Repeatedly</b>.
Users therefore have <b>greater control</b>, and can:
<li>Give <b>clear</b> and <b>precise</b> instructions to operating systems.</li>
<li>Repeat tasks and <b>reproduce the result exactly</b> by issuing the same command that was used to perform the original task.</li>
<li>Clearly <b>document</b> task methodologies by recording the necessary commands, and possibly integrating them into a bash script.</li>
<li><b>Automate</b> tasks and operations. The same command(s) can be issued to multiple files, multiple times.</li>
<br />
Beyond the benefits listed above, learning how to interact with computers via the command line introduces users to the logic and language of computer programming. This is hugely important for not only developers, but also anyone who does any kind of analytical work using code. A basic understanding will help uncover the true power available from your computer system, and will be vital to efficiently debug issues that come up when performing analytical tasks. The command line makes data science reproducible and scalable, and ultimately makes the user <b>more efficient</b>.<br>


<h2>Use of software packages</h2>

Whether you're a developer, data scientist or analyst, you're likely to make use of mainstream software packages and tools in the course of your daily work.<br>
<br />




<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git">Git</a>, for example, is a modern version control system that has been broadly adopted as the go-to for version control. Though GUIs for Git do exist, Git was originally designed for command line use, and the full functionality of Git can be only be exploited via the command line. Generally only partial functionality can be offered through GUIs. To understand Git properly, having a basic working knowledge of the command line will be extremely helpful. <br>

When writing a computer program, or analysis script, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide"><b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nviroments (IDEs)</a> enable programmers to write code with the aid of syntax highlighting and autocomplete, while providing (at a minimum) build and debugging tools in the same application. This boosts programming efficiency when developing and editing code. An example below shows the RStudio IDE.
